# Tetris-Game
Tetris Game built with Javascript

I rebuilt this Tetris Game from a Youtube Tutorial.
I changed some things... for example:
the game has 10 Levels, every 3 minutes it switches to the next Level, which is 100ms faster!
It starts at Refreshrate at 1000ms, at 100ms it stays there (which is level 10);
The Level is displayed under the score field.
